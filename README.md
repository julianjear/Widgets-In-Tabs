# Widgets-In-Tabs
Widgets in Tabs is an application that I developed my sophomore year of high school. The concept of widgets in tabs is to have a place where you could see all the information you need in one place. For example, on a daily basis, most of us check Facebook, Twitter, email, and many other things. Widgets in Tabs provides 5 different tabs in which you can chose to display a widget (Facebook, Twitter, email, or currency exchange). Each of these widgets would display the most important information from that widget. For example, Facebook would tell you how many new notifications and messages you have. Code files can be found in "Widgets iphone classes" folder. Looking back on the code, I am almost embarassed to share it because of how poorly written the code is. However, I wrote all of my first applications without a firm understanding of higher level programming concepts like classes and different types of data structures.
